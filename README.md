## Instructions

This plug-in provides you with the tools to import your favourite JSON and CSV table and create a set of Obsidian notes from that table. One note will be created for each row in a CSV file, or each object in a named array within the JSON file.

A magnifying-glass icon will appear in the left margin when this plug-in is enabled.

Clicking the icon will open a dialog window with some fields:

- "Choose JSON/CSV File" will allow to you pick any .json or .csv file.

- "Specify URL to JSON data" will allow you to enter the URL of a web location from which to retrieve some JSON data.

- "Choose TEMPLATE File" will allow you to choose any .md file, which should be a [Handlebars template file](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).

- "Choose HELPERS File" will allow you to specify a separate .js file which contains additional handlebars helper functions (see below).

- "Field containing the data" is used with a JSON file if a child of the top object should be used as the source of data instead of the very top of the JSON object.

- "Each subfield is a separate note" can be set to indicate that the JSON object identified by "Field containing the data" actually contains a separate field for each note to be created (rather than the JSON object being an array).

- "Field to use as Note name" will allow you to specify the JSON field/CSV column within each row of the table which should be used as the name of the note. Optionally, the name can be constructed from more than one field in the record/row using "${field}" to denote each field in the overall name pattern, for example "${country}-${town}". Alternatively, the name can be constructed using a small amount of javascript by wrapping the JS code as `@{...js...}` which should contain a return statement providing the name (the JS code can reference `this.field` for fields within the current record being processed, or `dataRoot.field` to access anything within the overall JSON file.)

- "Add suffix on duplicate Note Names" will append a number to the note name if the same name is found more than once in the import data (it will NOT avoid conflicts with Notes that existed in the Vault before the import).

- "Note name prefix/suffix" allows optional text to be put at the start (prefix) and/or end (suffix) of the name of the created Notes.

- "Allow paths in Note name" will create "/" in the given note name to be used to create folders within your vault. If not selected, then any occurrence of "/" will be replaced by "_".

- "How to handle existing Notes" is available when you want to overwrite, or append to, existing notes already in your vault.

- "Name of Destination Folder" allows you to set the top-level folder name within your Vault into which all the notes will be placed.

When the IMPORT button is pressed then the JSON/CSV file will be read and all the notes created.

### Arrays inside arrays

If you have a JSON structure which has a top-level array in which each record contains an array, you can create a separate note for each of the nested arrays by specifying the path in the "Field containing the data", using a variable name for the array index (the variable name becomes available as `@variablename` in the MD file).

For example, setting the field to `logs[logid].logEntries` where logEntries is also an array, will create a note for each entry in the logEntries array of every entry in the higher logs array; and the MD file can access fields in the higher logs[] array using (in this case) the prefix `@logid`.

Yes, it should be possible to access multiple nested levels of arrays.

### Notes

If your Handlebars template file tries to reference something in the JSON data which isn't a simple text field, then the generated note will contain the text \[object Object].

A notice will appear for each such note, but opening Obsidian's dev window (on MS Windows use Ctrl+Shift+i) will also show the list of affected notes.

The CSV decoder should auto-detect the actual separator from any of: comma, tab, pipe, semicolon, ASCII record separator (30), ASCII unit separator (31). (Blank lines in the CSV file will be ignored.)

Ensure that column names in CSV files contain only characters which make valid JSON variable/field names as required by Handlebars (e.g. no spaces or periods).

For CSV decoding, the list of detected delimiter, linebreak, and fields (column names) are displayed in the Obsidian Developer Console.

You can set up an Obsidian Hotkey to open the dialog, if you don't want to use the icon in the left bar.

The importer will only read the first object from the supplied JSON file. (So won't, for example, import a full set of entries from a Foundry VTT db file.)

### Batch Processing

If multiple passes are required on the source file in order to create all the notes, then a batch file can be generated to automate multiple passes. The batch file is a JSON file containing a single array with one or more objects as elements.

Each element defines how the parameters of the parse should change for this and future iterations. (If a field is omitted from a later element of the array, then the last set value in an earlier array element will remain in force.)

- "fieldName"  - sets a new value for "Field containing the data".
- "noteName"   - sets a new value for "Field to use as Note name".
- "folderName" - sets a new value for "Name of Destination Folder in Vault".
- "namePrefix" - sets a new value for "Note name prefix".
- "nameSuffix" - sets a new value for "Name name suffix".
- "batchStep"  - a string which can be read in the handlebars template file with `@importBatchStep` to select the appropriate section of the handlebars template file. (It will be an empty string if not explicitly set in a particular element of the batch array).

The handlebars template file can use `{{#if (eq @importSettings.topField "pack.burgs") )}}` or similar to then select the correct part of the template file to use for each iteration through the batch file.

An example batch.json file is:

```json
[
    {
        "fieldName": "pack.burgs",
        "noteName": "@{return `${(this.state > 0) && dataRoot.pack.states.find(state => state.i === this.state)?.name || \"Unknown\" }-${this.name}`}",
        "folderName": "import/burgs"
    },
    {
        "fieldName": "pack.states",
        "noteName": "name",
        "folderName": "import/states"
    }
]
```

### New Handlebars variables

Various top-level variables can be accessed to get information about the conversion being undertaken:
- `@importSourceIndex`: If the source data is an array (which is always the case for CSV files) this will be the index into the array, otherwise it will be the name of the field within the 'Field containing the data' object which is being used to create the current note.
- `@importDataRoot`: Is the entirety of the JSON file that was loaded (in case you need to access anything that is outside of the element currently being converted into a Note).
- `@importSourceFile` (File: the source file containing the CSV/JSON data [.name and .path are available])
- `@importHelperFile` (File: the file containing the JS handlebars helpers [.name and .path are available])
- `@importSettings` (Values from the Dialog window)
  - `@importSettings.jsonName`: (string) "Field to use as Note name"
  - `@importSettings.jsonNamePath`: (boolean) "Allow paths in Note name"
  - `@importSettings.jsonUrl`: (string) "Specify URL to JSON data"
  - `@importSettings.folderName`: (string) "Name of Destination Folder in Vault"
  - `@importSettings.topField`: (string) "Field containing the data"
  - `@importSettings.notePrefix`: (string) "Note name prefix"
  - `@importSettings.noteSuffix`: (string) "Note name suffix"
  - `@importSettings.handleExistingNote`: (integer) "How to handle existing Notes"
  - `@importSettings.forceArray`: (boolean) "Each subfield is a separate note"
  - `@importSettings.multipleJSON`: (boolean) "Data contains multiple JSON objects"

#### Additional fields for JavaScript used in creating a note name dynamically.

The following variables are available inside the javascript which 

- `this.SourceIndex`: If the source data is an array (which is always the case for CSV files) this will be the index into the array, otherwise it will be the name of the field within the 'Field containing the data' object which is being used to create the current note. _This has been superceded by `@importSourceIndex`._
- `this.dataRoot` : contains the entire object defined by the JSON file selected for import.
- `this.SourceFilename` : references the filename from which the JSON data was read.

### Additional Handlebar Functions

When building handlebars template files, you will have access to all the [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/Budibase/handlebars-helpers)

### New Handlebar Functions

#### Table Lookup

A new inline helper "{{table" is available. It is used to lookup a value in a static look-up table and replace it with another value.

- The first parameter is the value to be translated into another value.
- value1 is the value to be compared to the lookup value.
- result1 is the result of the {{table}} helper if the lookup value is equal to value1
- value2 result2 = second set of possible matches
- etc, as many pairs of value/result as you need.
(any/all of the lookup value and value/result values can be fields or fixed strings)
- value* can contain a [javascript regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
- result* can contain capturing groups (e.g. $1) to copy information from the matching string.

```hb
{{!-- {{table "blue" "red" "angry" "blue" "sad" "yellow" "envious" "green" "happy"}}   --}}
{{!-- will be converted into the string 'sad'  (taking "blue" and looking for the value/result pair that matches) --}}
{{table lookup value1 result1 value2 result2 value3 result3}}
```

#### substring

{{substring string start length}}

This will return a string containing the part of 'string' starting at offset start (0=first letter) and will return 'length' characters from that offset (if the string is shorter than start+length, then the remainder of the string will be returned).

```hb
{{substring "HAROLD" 3 2}}
{{!-- will return the string "OL", since 3 corresponds to the fourth letter in the string, and 2 refers to the number of characters to return starting at that position. --}}
```

#### strarray

{{strarray "HAROLD"}}

Converts the supplied string into an array of characters; primarily for use with #each to iterate over each letter in a string.

#### replacereg

{{replacereg string regexp replace}}

This searches 'string' for any matches with the regular expression 'regexp' string provided (do NOT use toRegExp, just provide the string), and replaces each occurrence with the 'replace' string (the 'replace' string can contain place markers from the regexp string).

#### strsplit

{{strsplit string separator}}

This splits 'string' at all occurrences of 'separator' (which may be a Regex) and returns an array containing all the parts of the string.

If the separator is a regex then you can include () around the regex to include the separator in the array of output strings (note that the separator is a separate element in the array).

#### setvar

{{setvar varName varValue}}

This assigns varValue to a local variable called varName (it will be created if it doesn't already exist). Usually varName will be a string, so it will need to be wrapped in double-quote marks.

The variable can be used later in the handlebars template using the expression {{varName}}

The {{setVar...}} function itself does not put any string into the generated output.

### Adding your own Handlebars Helpers

You can specify an optional "HELPER" file, which should contain some javascript containing your additional handlebars helpers. See <https://handlebarsjs.com/api-reference/helpers.html> for more information.

An example helpers.js is:

```js
function hb_farling() {
    let orig = arguments[0];
    orig += ' from Helper';
    return orig;
}

handlebars.registerHelper('farling', hb_farling);
```

The important component is to call `handlebars.registerHelper` with the name of the helper and the function that is implementing the helper. It is a good practise to prefix the name of the helper functions with `hb_` to ensure that they don't conflict with other function names in the module. (Note that it is YOUR responsibility to ensure that the javascript in the helper functions don't break your Obsidian vault.)

which would allow the following to be specified in your template MD file:

```md
{{farling 'Some Text'}}
```
